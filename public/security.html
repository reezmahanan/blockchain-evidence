        <h1>Security Policy</h1>

        <p>
            Security is a core principle of the Blockchain Evidence Management System.
            This document outlines the measures taken to protect data, users, and system integrity.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Blockchain Security</h2>
        <p>
            Evidence records are stored using blockchain technology, ensuring immutability,
            transparency, and resistance to tampering once data is verified.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Wallet & Authentication Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Private keys remain under user control and are never stored on our servers.</li>
            <li>Authentication via MetaMask ensures cryptographic identity verification.</li>
            <li>Email/password authentication follows secure hashing and validation practices.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Protection</h2>
        <p>
            Sensitive metadata is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
            Access is controlled using role-based permissions to ensure least-privilege access.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Vulnerability Reporting</h2>
        <p>
            If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.
            We encourage ethical disclosure to help maintain system safety.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Continuous Improvement</h2>
        <p>
            Security practices are reviewed and updated regularly to align with
            ISO 27001 and NIST Cybersecurity Framework guidelines.
